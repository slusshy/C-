METHOD 1.
# include <iostream>   /This is called header file/
int main()             /This line starts the main function in which our execuatable program is present/
{
	std::cout << "hello world";  /std::cout is used to print the output/
	return 0;
}

METHOD 2. / In this case we have used namespace so that we do not have to write std:: we can just write cout to print the output/
# include <iostream> 
using namespace std
int main()          
{
	cout << "hello world";
	return 0;
}
